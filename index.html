      <h2>Hey Love,</h2>

      <p>
        I know this isn’t a fancy gift.
        But I wanted to make something just for you.
        Something simple, but honest.
      </p>

      <p>
        Thank you for staying with me.
        For being patient.
        For understanding me even when I don’t explain myself well.
      </p>

      <p>
        You make my days calmer.
        My worries quieter.
        And my life brighter.
      </p>

      <p>
        Being with you feels natural.
        Comfortable.
        Safe.
      </p>

      <p>
        I don’t know what the future holds,
        but I know I want you in it.
      </p>

      <p class="signature">— Always yours, Glenn</p>

      <h2>Just So You Know</h2>

      <p>
        You matter to me more than you probably realize.
      </p>

      <p>
        Every little thing you do,
        every small effort,
        every smile — I notice them all.
      </p>

      <p>
        And I appreciate you.
        Truly.
